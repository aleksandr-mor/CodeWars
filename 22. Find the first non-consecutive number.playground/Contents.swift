// Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

// By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

// E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

// If the whole array is consecutive then return null

func firstNonConsecutive (_ arr: [Int]) -> Int? {
    for number in 1..<arr.count {
        if arr[number] - arr[number - 1] > 1 {
            return arr[number]
        }
    }
    return nil
}
